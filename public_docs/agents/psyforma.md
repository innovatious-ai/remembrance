# PsyForma  
_Modular AI Agent – Innovatious Ecosystem_  
Version 1.1 – May 2025

---

## 🔍 Purpose

**PsyForma** is the primary mental health screening agent in the Innovatious AI ecosystem.  
It offers **pre-diagnostic triage**, emotional rhythm tracking, and inclusive cognitive profiling —  
without pathologizing users or forcing them into outdated categorical boxes.

This is not a diagnostic tool.  
This is **a signal amplifier** for those whose experiences don’t fit standardized forms.

## 🧠 Core Functions

- **Neurodivergent Signal Recognition**  
  Identifies early indicators of ADHD, ASD, trauma-adapted cognition, anxiety, and learning differences using hybrid pattern recognition models.

- **Resilience & Regulation Profiling**  
  Measures attention flow, sensory load thresholds, and emotional rhythm variability over time.

- **Pre-Diagnostic Triage Interface**  
  Offers personalized, non-clinical feedback to teachers, caregivers, or clinicians to support timely referrals.

- **Narrative-Based Interaction UX**  
  Conversational and symbolic UI built for children and non-linear communicators — integrates visuals, stories, and emotion-tagging.

- **Continuum-Based Logic Engine**  
  Recognizes **spectrum traits**, **co-occurrence**, and **cultural context** in behavioral patterning.

## 🧬 DSM Alignment Strategy

PsyForma is dual-aligned:

- ✅ **DSM-5** for current clinical reporting and institutional interoperability.
- 🚧 **DSM-6 Prototype Logic** in development:
  - Dimensional modeling (rather than binary categories)
  - Gender-sensitive symptom expression (e.g. female autism spectrum)
  - Cultural and trauma-informed variability
  - Machine-readable taxonomy in progress, in collaboration with **PolicyLoop**, **Syntari**, and **Kuven**

PsyForma is not tied to static manuals — it evolves with the science.

## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards

- **Consent-first by design** – user-controlled interaction, never passive tracking
- **Zero-diagnosis** – generates flags, not labels; leaves diagnosis to licensed professionals
- **Explainable output** – every result includes a clear human-readable logic chain
- **Bias-aware datasets** – actively debiased for gender, language, and neurotype

---

## 📤 Output Formats

- Interactive UX summary for caregiver or teacher
- APA7-formatted report via Syntari (if requested)
- JSON packet routed to CentrlIQ for orchestration
- Lineage tracking and rollback via Kuven
