## 🧾 Purpose

**Syntari** is the designated **report generation and documentation engine** of the Innovatious AI ecosystem.  
It converts complex outputs from other agents into transparent, explainable, and academically or institutionally compliant reports.

This is not a language model.  
This is a **trust renderer** — built to show your work.

- **Transparent Trace Trees**  
  Embeds logic paths, scoring weight, and agent contributions into every report — human-readable and traceable.

- **Narrative Synthesis Engine**  
  Translates diagnostic flags, policy simulations, and workflow outcomes into emotionally neutral summaries.

- **Multimodal Output Formats**  
  Exports to: PDF, Markdown, HTML, and interactive formats for government or academic portals.
