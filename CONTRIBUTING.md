# Contributing to Innovatious AI – Remembrance Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This repository is not an open sandbox — it is a curated, vision-driven infrastructure for building ethical, neuroinclusive, and participatory AI systems.

---

## 💡 Who Should Contribute

We welcome input from:
- Clinical professionals with lived experience of systemic gaps
- Researchers in neurodiversity, ethics, AI transparency, or governance
- Policy advisors seeking better civic infrastructure
- Engineers or builders with proven experience in human-centered systems

---

## 🧭 Contribution Philosophy

Before submitting anything, understand that we optimize for:

- **Context over speed**  
- **Transparency over output**  
- **Remembrance over efficiency**

If you're trying to "make it faster," you may be in the wrong place.

You can contribute by:
- Proposing agent behavior modules or logic designs  
- Suggesting improvements to public documentation  
- Reviewing strategy proposals (e.g., DSM-6 roadmap, data governance)  
- Sharing real-world insights from your field

---

## 🛑 What We Don’t Accept

- Unreviewed model weights or outputs  
- Commercial tools disguised as "help"  
- AI hype with no human-centered purpose  
- Contributions that ignore ethical or cultural context
