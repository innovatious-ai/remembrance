# PolicyLoop  
_Modular AI Agent – Innovatious Ecosystem_  
Version 1.0 – May 2025

---

## 🔍 Purpose

**PolicyLoop** is a civic-intelligence agent built to **simulate policy outcomes** and gather **real-time stakeholder feedback** from citizens, educators, clinicians, and public servants.

It closes the loop between **governance** and the governed — by turning lived experience into actionable policy data.

This is not an opinion box.  
This is structured participatory intelligence.

## 🧠 Core Functions

- **Stakeholder Feedback Engine**  
  Translates qualitative and quantitative input from citizens into semantic logic trees usable in policymaking.

- **Policy Simulation Interface**  
  Models policy drafts across dimensions like cost, accessibility, inclusion, and mental health impact.

- **Sentiment & Impact Analysis**  
  Monitors emotional tone, urgency, and thematic clusters from user responses across institutions.

- **Use-Case Agility**  
  Customizable for:
  - Education reform
  - Health access
  - Digital services feedback
  - Neuroinclusion policy design

- **Multi-level Governance Sync**  
  Routes feedback from municipal to national systems with priority tagging.

## 🧬 Compliance & Transparency

- Fully aligned with **EU AI Act** Article 10 (Transparency and Feedback)
- Public dashboard outputs built with **Syntari**
- Data traceable and auditable via **TraceAgent**
- All policy simulations version-tracked and time-stamped by **Kuven**

## 🛡️ Ethics Protocols

- **No data used without explicit opt-in**
- **Feedback weighted by context**, not volume — to prevent majority bias
- **Feedback reviewed by human-in-the-loop validators** in sensitive policy domains
- **Adaptive participation UX** for neurodivergent, low-literacy, and nonverbal users

---

## 📤 Outputs

- Visual policy simulations with outcome deltas
- Annotated policy drafts with impact overlays
- Public-facing summaries + PDF reports via Syntari
- JSON policy tree exported for CentrlIQ orchestration
