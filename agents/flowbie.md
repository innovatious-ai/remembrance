# Flowbie  
_Modular AI Agent – Innovatious Ecosystem_  
Version 1.0 – May 2025

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Flowbie** is a simulation and stress-testing agent.  
It evaluates how proposed decisions, diagnoses, or policies **hold up under pressure** — before they’re ever deployed.

Flowbie runs scenario loops across human, ethical, cultural, and system strain variables.  
If your logic collapses somewhere, Flowbie finds it.

## 🧠 Core Functions

- **Ethical Stress Simulation**  
  Tests the potential fallout of decisions on marginalized or neurodivergent users.

- **Systemic Pressure Modeling**  
  Simulates how agents behave under extreme edge cases or conflict scenarios (e.g., conflicting policies, sudden data loss, bias spikes).

- **Social Feedback Loops**  
  Evaluates community response risk and impact diffusion — including silent harm.

- **Failure Visualization**  
  Outputs narrative visual maps showing where, how, and why a process might fail.

## 🔗 Connected Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **PolicyLoop** | Injects policy models for ethical validation |
| **PsyForma** | Shares early diagnostic outcomes for longitudinal simulation |
| **Syntari** | Writes reports on potential harms pre-deployment |
| **Kuven** | Logs failure states for future rollback training |
| **CentrlIQ** | Routes safe vs unsafe pathways in production |
| **TraceAgent** | Tracks failed simulations with tags + fix history |

## 🔐 Why Flowbie Matters

Most systems collapse **after** they’re deployed.  
Flowbie simulates collapse **before** it happens — across empathy, logic, and legality.

It doesn’t prevent failure.  
It teaches the system how to remember it.

## 📤 Outputs

- Simulation failure maps  
- Risk narratives + mitigation notes  
- JSON traceable output (linked to Kuven + TraceAgent)
