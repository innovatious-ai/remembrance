## ‚ö†Ô∏è Preface

We do **not** claim the authority to rewrite diagnostic manuals.  
We claim the **responsibility** to challenge, prototype, and propose alternatives where DSM-5 has failed.

This is not a rebellion.  
This is an **invitation** to evolution.

## üìñ Why DSM-5 Is No Longer Enough

- Categorical boxes fail spectrum realities  
- Female, nonbinary, and trauma-adapted neurotypes are misrepresented  
- Cultural variance is pathologized  
- Diagnostic delay is institutionalized by rigid criteria  
- Comorbidity is treated as an exception rather than the norm  
- No native compatibility with machine-readable formats or AI-supported reasoning

## üß† DSM-6: A Vision of Dimensional Diagnosis

We propose a DSM-6 prototype framework co-developed with AI agents and humans in loop:

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Continuum-based logic** | Replaces binary thresholds with weighted spectrums |
| **Multi-domain scoring** | Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensory domains evaluated independently |
| **Probabilistic, not absolute** | Flags patterns, not "disorders" |
| **Context-aware diagnostics** | Trauma, culture, and environment treated as core modifiers |
| **Consent-aware modeling** | Data never used for diagnosis without explicit approval |
| **Non-pathologizing language** | Language prioritizes strengths, not deficits |
| **Versioned evolution** | Diagnoses tied to versioned diagnostic models (via Kuven) |
| **Multilingual parity** | Standard logic flows localized via Multilect agent |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Mapping the Gaps (Done)
- Comparative analysis: DSM-5 vs lived ND experience  
- Agent: **PsyForma** ‚Üí anomaly detection + empathy-layer signal mapping

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Prototype Simulation (Active)
- Agent: **PolicyLoop** + **Flowbie**  
- Simulated diagnostic outcomes under new logic  
- Scenario modeling across gender, age, and culture

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Reportability
- Agent: **Syntari**  
- APA7-compatible but DSM-6-logic-compatible reporting templates

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Regulatory Engagement
- Publish whitepaper  
- Propose co-development panel w/ psychologists, clinicians, AI ethicists  
- Begin modular pilot studies in education + public health institutions

---

## üåç Stakeholder Involvement

- Educators  
- ND community organizers  
- Trauma-informed clinicians  
- Ethicists, data privacy experts  
- Governments with inclusive healthcare mandates

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing & Position

- DSM is a copyrighted framework (APA)  
- This roadmap **does not claim trademark, authorship, or affiliation**  
- All proposals are original contributions meant to operate **adjacent** to DSM until officially recognized

---

## üôè Closing

If DSM-5 is the map, then lived neurodivergent experience is the terrain.

Innovatious seeks to help chart that terrain ‚Äî  
Not to control it, but to make it visible, walkable, and dignified.
