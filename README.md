# Remembrance – Innovatious AI

A modular, ethical AI infrastructure built for neuroinclusion, transparent diagnostics, and civic policy simulation.

This public repository documents the architecture, philosophy, and logic of the Remembrance system — an alternative to black-box tools and exclusionary legacy software in public systems.

## 🌍 What This Is

**Remembrance** is the foundation of Innovatious AI, developed to serve:

- Early mental health diagnostics (**PsyForma**)
- Participatory policy simulations (**PolicyLoop**)
- Traceable report generation (**Syntari**)
- Ethical failure modeling (**Flowbie**)
- Memory and audit infrastructure (**Kuven**, **TraceAgent**)

All components are modular agents, designed for adaptation within education, healthcare, and governance.

## 🔒 Ethics & Compliance

- GDPR-compliant memory and trace logs  
- EU AI Act Article 10 & 12 alignment  
- APA7-compatible diagnostic outputs  
- Transparent licensing: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

> We don’t retrofit ethics. We start with it.
