# Remembrance – Innovatious AI

A modular, ethical AI infrastructure built for neuroinclusion, transparent diagnostics, and civic policy simulation.

This public repository documents the architecture, philosophy, and logic of the Remembrance system — an alternative to black-box tools and exclusionary legacy software in public systems.

## 🌍 What This Is

**Remembrance** is the foundation of Innovatious AI, developed to serve:

- Early mental health diagnostics (PsyForma)
- Participatory policy simulations (PolicyLoop)
- Traceable report generation (Syntari)
- Ethical failure modeling (Flowbie)
- Memory and audit infrastructure (Kuven, TraceAgent)

All components are modular agents, designed for adaptation within education, healthcare, and governance.

---

## 🔒 Ethics & Compliance

- GDPR-compliant memory and trace logs  
- EU AI Act Article 10 & 12 alignment  
- APA7-compatible diagnostic outputs  
- Transparent licensing: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

We don’t retrofit ethics. We start with it.
